# Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving ML

A federated learning framework for training machine learning models on decentralized data while preserving user privacy. This project demonstrates how to train models on distributed datasets without sharing raw data.

## Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Use differential privacy and secure aggregation techniques.
- **Decentralized Data**: Train models on distributed datasets (e.g., medical imaging or IoT devices).
- **Framework Integration**: Leverage PySyft and TensorFlow Federated for federated learning.
- **Real-World Application**: Apply to healthcare or financial datasets for privacy-sensitive tasks.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate model accuracy and privacy guarantees.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for deployment)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Training
To train a federated model:
```bash
./scripts/train.sh
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the federated model:
```bash
./scripts/evaluate.sh
```

## Configuration

The project is configured using YAML files in the `configs/` directory:
- **`train_config.yaml`**: Configuration for federated training (e.g., number of clients, differential privacy settings).
- **`eval_config.yaml`**: Configuration for evaluation (e.g., datasets, metrics).
- **`deploy_config.yaml`**: Configuration for deployment (e.g., API host, port).

## File Generation

The following files and directories are **generated or populated** during the setup and execution of the federated learning pipeline:

### 1. **Data Files**
- **`data/raw/`**: Contains raw datasets (e.g., medical imaging or IoT data).
- **`data/processed/`**: Contains preprocessed datasets for federated training.
- **`data/clients/`**: Contains data partitioned for each client in the federated learning setup.

### 2. **Model Files**
- **`models/pretrained/`**: Contains pretrained model files (e.g., initial global model).
- **`models/fine_tuned/`**: Contains fine-tuned model files generated during federated training.

### 3. **Log Files**
- **`logs/training.log`**: Logs generated during federated training.
- **`logs/evaluation.log`**: Logs generated during model evaluation.

### 4. **Notebooks**
- **`notebooks/federated_training_demo.ipynb`**: Demonstrates federated training with PySyft.
- **`notebooks/differential_privacy_demo.ipynb`**: Demonstrates differential privacy techniques.
- **`notebooks/performance_benchmark.ipynb`**: Benchmarks the performance of the federated model.

### 5. **Test Files**
- **`tests/test_federated_model.py`**: Unit tests for the federated model.
- **`tests/test_differential_privacy.py`**: Unit tests for differential privacy mechanisms.
- **`tests/test_secure_aggregation.py`**: Unit tests for secure aggregation techniques.

## Workflows

### Training Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Raw data is preprocessed and partitioned for each client.
2. **Federated Training**: The global model is trained on decentralized data using federated learning.
3. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a centralized test set.

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **API Deployment**: The federated learning framework is deployed as a service.
2. **Monitoring**: Model performance and privacy guarantees are monitored in real-time.

### Retraining Pipeline
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Model performance is continuously monitored.
2. **Automated Retraining**: If performance drops below a threshold, the model is retrained using federated learning.
